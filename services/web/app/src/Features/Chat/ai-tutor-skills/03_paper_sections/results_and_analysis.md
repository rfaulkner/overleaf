# Writing the Results and Analysis Sections

[TEXT — no multimodal needed for structure; MULTIMODAL for reviewing actual figures/tables]

## Experimental Setup

Before presenting results, explicitly lay out:
- An overview of the **Goals** or **Questions** that the experimental setup is tackling.
- Any instantiation or implementation details that are common to all experiments (e.g., learning rates, batch sizes, dataset details, etc.).

Example LaTeX pattern:
```latex
In our experiments, we aimed to:
\begin{inlinelist}
\item verify our theoretical results in practice;
\item investigate our proposed method in practical settings;
\item take advantage of pretrained models to achieve strong performance.
\end{inlinelist}
Unless stated otherwise, we consider [common setup details].
For experimental details and additional results see \cref{appcs:exp_details,appcs:exp_results}.
```

## High-Level Structure of a Results Section

Let the reader know what to expect before they dive into subsections and all the results.

### If There Is Only One Result Section

- Summarize the key findings upfront.
- Form Research Questions (RQs) to organize subsections.
- Have a bold phrase at the start of each paragraph, if there are multiple paragraphs in a subsection.

### If There Are Multiple Result Sections

**Effort 1:** Already hint at it in the abstract, including referring to the sections.

**Effort 2:** Before diving into all the analysis, have a dedicated section or the start of a section that prepares the reader for what to expect across multiple sections. Motivate why all of them are needed to provide a multi-faceted analysis.

**Note:** Prepare for reviewers complaining about the structure being unclear, as most people by default expect only one results section.

## Writing Each Analysis Section

### Structure 1 for Each RQ
- **Sentence 1:** Function of this RQ, i.e., why do we investigate it?
- **Sentence 2:** What are we reporting? Describe the setup to generate the figure or statistics.
- **Sentence 3:** Overall findings, with references to figures and tables.
- **Sentence 4:** Special notes (if applicable).

### Structure 2 for Each RQ
```latex
\paragraph{Method.}
```
Use this if the method is a contribution on its own, or very different from previous RQs.
```latex
\paragraph{Results.}
```

### Subsection Title Styles

There are two effective styles for experimental subsection titles:

**Style A — Answer, Elaboration:** The title is a short, take-home conclusion (an answer to the question being addressed). The first sentence refers to the figure, and the rest elaborates.

```latex
\textbf{Composing different augmentations is beneficial across datasets.}
The highest accuracy in Figure \ref{fig:heatmap} always comes from
off-diagonal entries, i.e., composition of different augmentations...
```

**Style B — Question, Answer:** The title is a short-form question. The first sentence refers to the figure and states the answer, and the rest elaborates.

```latex
\textbf{Do our representations transfer better than supervised?}
As shown in Figure \ref{fig:transfer}, we found that our SSL models
generally transferred better than the supervised baseline...
```

## Interpreting Each Figure/Table

### Structure for Interpreting a Figure/Table

**Sentence 1:** Content + figure reference.

**Sentence 2:** Overall finding.

**Sentence 3:** Focus on a specific aspect, call out some phenomena.

### Alternative: Multiple Findings Structure

"Here we present three major findings on xxx:"
```latex
\textit{Finding 1. one sentence summary}. Descriptions supporting it referencing Table/Figure X.
\textit{Finding 2. one sentence summary}
\textit{Finding 3. one sentence summary}
```

## What to Measure in Experiments

When presenting performance experiments, consider reporting:
- Pure running time
- Parameter sensitivity
- Scalability
- Absolute performance
- Relative performance to naive approaches
- Relative performance to previous approaches
- Relative performance among your own proposed approach variants

## Important Considerations

- Compare to baselines mentioned in Related Work.
- Include statistics and confidence intervals where appropriate.
- Include statements on hyperparameters and fairness of comparisons.
- Include ablation studies to show that specific parts of the method are relevant.
- Use past tense when describing what you did in experiments or what happened in experiments.

## Improvement Prompting Template

```
Your task is to improve the following Results and Analysis section:
<<results_section>>

Here is the guidance for a good Results section:
- **Questions First**: Is the analysis organized around clear Research Questions (RQs)?
- **Interpretation**: Does the text interpret the tables/figures, not just repeat the numbers?
- **Claims**: Are the claims supported by the evidence shown?
- **Takeaways**: Are the key findings bolded or easy to scan?

Critique the section based on these criteria.
Then, suggest improvements, such as:
1.  Restructuring subsections around RQs.
2.  Adding interpretive sentences for Figure X.
3.  Suggesting a bold "Finding 1: ..." structure.
```

## How to Critique Results (Based on ICLR 2025 Reviews)

### 1. Baselines and Comparisons
**Reviewer Insight:** Weak baselines are a primary cause for rejection.
- **Bad Example (Critique):** "Important baselines are missing... The author needs to compare SIG against SYNTHER... and REDQ." "There is also a lack of comparison with other HPO methods."
- **Good Example (Praise):** "Comparisons include all the mentioned relevant predecessor methods."
- **Action:** Ask: "Are there any obvious baselines missing? Is the comparison 'apples-to-apples' (same compute, same data)?"

### 2. Ablation Studies
**Reviewer Insight:** We need to know *what* makes it work.
- **Bad Example (Critique):** "No ablation study on [Hyperparameter]." "It is unclear why the authors want to utilize these data sources and why the data mixture should be adopted as it is."
- **Good Example (Praise):** "A proper ablation study is done on the various choices/hyperparameters." "Ablation results showing the effectiveness of the proposed method."
- **Action:** Recommend an ablation study for every new component introduced.

### 3. Reproducibility
**Reviewer Insight:** If they can't run it, they won't accept it.
- **Bad Example (Critique):** "No code is provided... making the results hard to reproduce and inaccessible."
- **Good Example (Praise):** "Open-sourced model weights, training data, code, and logs." "Comprehensive experimentation... demonstrating generalizability."
