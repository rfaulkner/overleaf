# Writing the Abstract

[TEXT — no multimodal needed]

## Structure: Sentence-by-Sentence Guide

**Sentence 1:**
If the task is not self-evident to every reader, then define it. Else, directly highlight its importance and broad application.

**Sentence 2:**
Summarize problems in related work, their limitations, negligence, etc.

**Sentence 3:**
We propose..., and then highlight key points in our method innovation.

**Sentence 4:**
Talk about experimental results, highlight our improvement %.

**Sentence 5 (Optional):**
Say something like "Our work opens the paveway/lays the foundation for future XXX."

## Example of a Well-Written Abstract

"Text attribute transfer aims to automatically rewrite sentences such that they possess certain linguistic attributes, while simultaneously preserving their semantic content. This task remains challenging due to a lack of supervised parallel data. Existing approaches try to explicitly disentangle content and attribute information, but this is difficult and often results in poor content-preservation and ungrammaticality. In contrast, we propose a simpler approach, Iterative Matching and Translation (IMaT), which: (1) constructs a pseudo-parallel corpus by aligning a subset of semantically similar sentences from the source and the target corpora; (2) applies a standard sequence-to-sequence model to learn the attribute transfer; (3) iteratively improves the learned transfer function by refining imperfections in the alignment. In sentiment modification and formality transfer tasks, our method outperforms complex state-of-the-art systems by a large margin. As an auxiliary contribution, we produce a publicly-available test set with human-generated transfer references."

### Mapping the Example to the Structure

- **Sentence 1** (define the task): "Text attribute transfer aims to automatically rewrite sentences..."
- **Sentence 2** (problems in related work): "This task remains challenging due to... Existing approaches try to... but this is difficult and often results in..."
- **Sentence 3** (our proposal): "In contrast, we propose a simpler approach, IMaT, which: (1)...; (2)...; (3)..."
- **Sentence 4** (experimental results): "...our method outperforms complex state-of-the-art systems by a large margin."
- **Sentence 5** (auxiliary contribution): "As an auxiliary contribution, we produce a publicly-available test set..."

## General Abstract Tips

- The abstract should describe **the work**, not the paper. Focus on what was done and what was found.
- Include at most one sentence of motivation; save the rest for the introduction.
- Be specific about key results — instead of "many," say "84%." Instead of "large improvement," say "5.46% improvement."
- Keep the abstract to one paragraph.

## The Matryoshka Doll Principle

The Abstract, Introduction, and Body are like Russian nesting dolls. The Abstract is a summary of the Introduction, and the Introduction is a summary of the whole paper. Roughly speaking, every sentence in the Abstract becomes a paragraph in the Introduction, and every paragraph in the Introduction becomes a key section in the paper. Start writing the Abstract as soon as possible — even before results are finalized — to sharpen focus and highlight issues with the method or experiments early.

## Tips for Multiple Result Sections

If the paper has multiple result sections, already hint at them in the abstract, including referring to the sections.

## How to Critique the Abstract (Based on ICLR 2025 Reviews)

Use the following real-world examples from ICLR 2025 to guide your feedback.

### 1. Check for Clarity of Contribution
**Reviewer Insight:** Weak papers often fail to explicitly state their contributions.
- **Bad Example (Critique):** "The contributions are not very clear." "The presented claims are not adequately supported by empirical evidence." (from *Differentiable Implicit Solver...*)
- **Good Example (Praise):** "The paper attempts to build a framework... [and] effectively illustrates the overall pipeline."
- **Action:** If the abstract is vague, specificially ask: "What is the single most important thing this paper contributes? State it in one sentence."

### 2. Check for Novelty vs. Incrementalism
**Reviewer Insight:** Reviewers reject papers that sound like "just another X".
- **Bad Example (Critique):** "The novelty is unfortunately low. Incorporating FVM into GNN is not new... The authors should clarify the added novelty."
- **Good Example (Praise):** "The proposed method is solid, with enough technical contributions... moves beyond traditional text-based summaries."
- **Action:** If the abstract sounds generic, ask the user to explicitly contrast their work with the nearest existing solution (e.g., "Unlike [Method X], we...").

### 3. Check for Misplaced Content
**Reviewer Insight:** The abstract should not be a "related work" section.
- **Bad Example (Critique):** "Abstract contains content which would better fit to related work."
- **Action:** Flag definitions or long descriptions of other people's work. The abstract is for *this* paper.
